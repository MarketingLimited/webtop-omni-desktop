# Container Service Fixes Applied

## Problem Summary
The container was experiencing cascading service failures due to D-Bus instability, causing supervisor restart loops.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced D-Bus Stability (`start-dbus-first.sh`)
- Robust startup with health monitoring
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Better error handling and logging

### 2. Service Dependencies (`wait-for-dbus.sh`)
- All services now wait for D-Bus readiness
- Prevents race conditions and startup failures

### 3. Missing Scripts Created
- `setup-desktop.sh` - KDE desktop environment setup
- `system-validation.sh` - Comprehensive health checks
- `enhanced-service-monitor.sh` - Intelligent monitoring

### 4. Optimized Supervisor Configuration
- Better service priorities and timing
- Graceful error handling
- Reduced restart loops

## Expected Results
- Stable D-Bus service without crashes
- Proper service startup sequence
- Reduced failure cascades
- Better system resilience
