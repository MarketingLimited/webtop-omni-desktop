# Documentation Archive

This directory contains deprecated, outdated, or superseded documentation files that have been removed from active use.

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

We preserve these files for:
- Historical reference
- Recovery if needed
- Understanding project evolution
- Preventing accidental information loss

## Archive Contents
